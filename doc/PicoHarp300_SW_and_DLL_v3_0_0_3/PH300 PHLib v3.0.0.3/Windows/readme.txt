This is the PicoQuant PicoHarp 300 programming library 'PHLib.dll' pack.
It may be distributed on CD, DVD, or as a zip file for download.
In case of a zip file, please unpack it to a temporary hard disk location. 

Note: Using the programming library requires a firmware update of your 
PicoHarp 300, unless you already bought it with the DLL option 
installed. You can purchase an upgrade and install it any time later.

The programming library is suitable for Windows 7, 8 and 10.  
On some Windows versions you may need administrator rights to do the setup.
Consult your manual for detailed installation instructions. 

The folder "installation" contains the PHLib setup file Setup.exe.
You can run Setup.exe directly from this folder on the CD or hard disk.

Do not connect the PicoHarp device before installing the software.

Before installation, make sure to backup any work you kept in previous
installation directories and uninstall any older versions of PHLib.
The PHLib package can be distributed on CD, via download or via email.
The setup distribution file is setup.exe.
If you received the package via download or email, it may be packed in a 
zip-file. Unzip that file and place the distribution setup file in a 
temporary disk folder. Start the installation by running setup.exe before
connecting the PicoHarp device.
On some versions of Windows you may need to log on as administrator.

The setup program will install the programming library including manual, 
and programming demos and the device driver for the PicoHarp. 
The setup program will copy the device driver but it will not immediately 
load it.  This is done by the regular Windows Plug&Play device management 
when you connect the device. Dependent on the version of Windows you may be 
prompted again at this stage in oder to confirm the driver installation. 

To uninstall the PHLib package, you may need to be logged on as administrator. 
Backup your measurement data before uninstalling.
From the start menu select:  PicoQuant - PH300-PHLib vx.x  >  uninstall.
Alternatively you can use the Control Panel Wizard 'Add/Remove Programs'
(in some Windows versions this Wizard is called 'Software')
