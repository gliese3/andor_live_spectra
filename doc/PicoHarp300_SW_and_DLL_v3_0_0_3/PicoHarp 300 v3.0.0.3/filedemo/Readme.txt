PicoHarp 300 TCSPC Software 

This folder contains demo programs (incl source code) for reading
PicoHarp data files. These are DEMOS. They are not designed to routinely 
convert PicoHarp files to ASCII. This would in most cases be inefficient 
and of little practical value. The objective is to enable users to write 
their own file reading and analysis programs. For format documentation 
please see the PicoHarp online help file available through the help menu 
of the PicoHarp software.
